<h4>Notice:</h4>
<p>For the next short while, KWmassage will not be excepting new clients.</p>
<p>I have been working with another RMT named Stephen Downey, doing treatment exchanges so that he will be familiar with my style of treatment. Stephen is very good and very strong, I suggest that you continue treatment with him for the time being. </p>
<p>Stephen works at <a href="http://perfectbalancewc.ca/">Perfect Balance Wellness</a>, you can connect with him at <strong>519.804.1697</strong>(office) or <strong>647.968.1973</strong>(cell).</p>
