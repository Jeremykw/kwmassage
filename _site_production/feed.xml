        <title>Does the Weather Make our Muscles Stiff? </title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s May 16th and the weather in the Kitchener, Waterloo has been miserable. We had a few weeks of warmish weather but now we are right back to cold and rainy. You might ask why a &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;massage therapist &lt;/a&gt;would care about the weather. It’s been good for business, that’s why I care. Our muscles get tight and stiff, old pains come back to the surface, and new ones come out. When this happens, we need to see our massage therapist.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our body’s main mechanism to create or retain heat is to increase our metabolism (the amount of food energy we burn). Our body does this by contracting our muscles. Notice how your shoulders rise up to your ears when you walk outside on a cold day without your jacket. Your legs, back, neck, shoulders, and all the muscles in your body will do this. This increase in muscle tension will increase stress on your joints, pull your body out of alignment, and create muscle imbalances. With this added stress to your body, many symptoms like&lt;a href=&quot;/stretching/stretch-your-upper-trapezius-muscle/index.html&quot;&gt; neck pain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/stretching/low-back-pain/index.html&quot;&gt;back pain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/generalmassagetherapy/tension-headaches-3/index.html&quot;&gt;headaches&lt;/a&gt;, and muscle achiness surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing your massage therapist will help decrease this muscle tension and correct your muscle imbalances.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Stretch Your Upper Trapezius Muscle </title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;To &lt;a href=&quot;/stretching/general-guidelines-for-stretching/index.html&quot;&gt;stretch&lt;/a&gt; your &lt;a href=&quot;/generalmassagetherapy/tension-headaches-3/index.html&quot;&gt;Upper Trapezius Muscle, &lt;/a&gt;begin in a seated position.With your shoulders relaxed and your head in a natural position, carefully bend your neck to bring your right ear toward your right armpit. If more pressure is needed to feel the &lt;a href=&quot;/stretching/general-guidelines-for-stretching/index.html&quot;&gt;stretch&lt;/a&gt;, you can use your right hand to gently pull from the side of your head just above your left ear toward your right armpit.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/up-trap-stretch-picture.jpg&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img style=”border: 1px solid black”class=”fleft rightmargin-sm leftmargin-sm” alt=”Stretch Upper Trapizius Muscle” src=”/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/up-trap-stretch-picture.jpg” width=”195” height=”151” /&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be careful not to allow your left shoulder to rise, as this will prevent the muscle from lengthening into a stretched position. Repeat on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to review to my &lt;a href=&quot;/stretching/general-guidelines-for-stretching/index.html&quot;&gt;General Guidelines for stretching &lt;/a&gt;before doing any of the stretches I demonstrate and recommend. It’s always a good idea to see a &lt;a href=&quot;/generalmassagetherapy/governance-of-massage-therapy/index.html&quot;&gt;health care professional &lt;/a&gt;before starting a new exercise program.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Stretch Your Levator Scapula </title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Levator Scapula muscle runs from the top tip of the shoulder blade up to the top four joints of the neck.  The Levator Scapula muscle lifts the shoulder blade and helps control side-to-side movement of the head. A &lt;a title=&quot;Trigger Points and Trigger Point Therapy&quot; href=&quot;/generalmassagetherapy/trigger-points-and-trigger-point-therapy/index.html&quot;&gt;Trigger Point&lt;/a&gt; in the Levator Scapula muscle can cause pain behind the head and to the back of the neck.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stretch your &lt;a href=&quot;/generalmassagetherapy/tension-headaches-3/index.html&quot;&gt;Levator Scapula &lt;/a&gt;muscle, begin in a seated position. &amp;lt;img style=&quot;border: 1px solid black&quot;class=&quot;fleft rightmargin-sm leftmargin-sm&quot; alt=&quot;Sretch Levaor Scapula Muscle&quot; src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/levator-stretch-pic.jpg&quot; width=&quot;191&quot; height=&quot;120&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With your shoulders relaxed and your head in a natural position, carefully tuck your chin towards your right armpit. If more pressure is needed to feel the stretch, you can use your right hand to gently pull from the top of your head toward the right armpit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure not to allow your left shoulder to rise, as this will prevent the muscle from lengthening in to a stretched position. Repeat on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to review to my &lt;a href=&quot;/stretching/general-guidelines-for-stretching/index.html&quot;&gt;General Guidelines for stretching &lt;/a&gt;before doing any of the stretches I demonstrate and recommend.

        <title>Massage Therapists in Kitchener and Waterloo </title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You might have noticed that there are over 300 &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/+Kwmassage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Registered Massage Therapists &lt;/a&gt;in the Kitchener- Waterloo area. This is due mainly to the fact that one of the major massage therapy schools, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.collegeofmassage.com/cambridge/&quot;&gt;Canadian College of Massage and Hydrotherapy &lt;/a&gt;is located in Kitchener. This high volume of massage therapists means higher competition between massage therapists. It also means higher levels of service for you, the massage therapy client. &lt;a href=&quot;/about/index.html&quot;&gt;Your massage therapist &lt;/a&gt;needs to be good to stand out and attract clients.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With so many registered Massage Therapists in Kitchener-Waterloo, there is no reason you shouldn’t be 100% happy with yours. Don’t be discouraged and don’t feel obligated to rebook or go back if you’re not happy with your new massage therapist. When you are happy, your therapist will appreciate the loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many therapists trying to set themselves apart from the others by learning and using new styles of &lt;a href=&quot;/clinic-information/index.html&quot;&gt;massage therapy&lt;/a&gt;. There are a lot of styles available for a massage therapist to learn, some of these more effective than others. Don’t be surprised to find your new massage therapist practicing a technique you weren’t expecting. This is fine; for every massage therapy client there is a massage therapist and a different style of massage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there are over 300 massage therapist in Kitchener and Waterloo, &lt;a href=&quot;/contact&quot;&gt;don’t be afraid to try a new one&lt;/a&gt;. Do your research, check out massage therapists online, read reviews on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yelp.ca/biz/kitchener-massage-therapy-kitchener&quot;&gt;Yelp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linkedin.com/profile/edit?trk=hb_tab_pro_top&quot;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/pages/KWmassage/354131367967709&quot;&gt;FaceBook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.ca/maps/place?rlz=1I7DDCA_en&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;redir_esc=&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=kitchener+massage+therapy&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;gl=ca&amp;amp;hq=massage+therapy&amp;amp;hnear=Kitchener,+ON&amp;amp;cid=4280028541904649170&amp;amp;ei=R2DATcqiM4WltwfcjeWxBQ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=local_result&amp;amp;ct=map-marker-link&amp;amp;resnum=1&amp;amp;ved=0CEAQrwswAA&quot;&gt;Google Places&lt;/a&gt;, call around and ask &lt;a href=&quot;/generalmassagetherapy/what-is-deep-tissue-massage&quot;&gt;what type of massage &lt;/a&gt;a potential therapist offers. See if they have experience dealing with what you need help with most. Personality also goes a long way, though I think you will find most massage therapist are easy to get along with.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Stretch Your Rhomboids </title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Your Rhomboids are muscles in between your shoulder blades. They often get sore and stiff from working at a computer with poor posture. If you need to stretch your Rhomboids, be sure to stretch your pectoral muscles as well.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are getting pain in your upper back, please see your &lt;a href=&quot;/about/index.html&quot;&gt;local massage therapist&lt;/a&gt; or other healthcare professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to review to my &lt;a href=&quot;/stretching/general-guidelines-for-stretching/index.html&quot;&gt;General Guidelines for stretching&lt;/a&gt; before doing any of the stretches I demonstrate and recommend. It’s always a good idea to see a &lt;a href=&quot;/generalmassagetherapy/governance-of-massage-therapy/index.html&quot;&gt;health care professional&lt;/a&gt; before starting a new exercise program.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rock Climbers and Our Fingers </title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Our fingers are some of our smallest extremities. &lt;a title=&quot;Rock Climbing Articles&quot; href=&quot;/knowledge-centre/rock-climbing/index.html&quot;&gt;Rock climbers&lt;/a&gt; put tremendous strain on their fingers, which can encourage an injury. It’s important to understand the anatomy of the hand and fingers to see what we can do to decrease the risk of climbing injury, and to also have a look at what to do if a finger injury happens.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our fingers have no muscles, and our hands only have small muscles meant for fine, controlled movement; those hand muscles aren't meant for the powerful explosive force needed for &lt;a title=&quot;Rock Climbing as a Lifestyle&quot; href=&quot;/about/rock-climbing-as-a-lifestyle/index.html&quot;&gt;rock climbing&lt;/a&gt;. The energy needed for rock climbing comes from the forearms instead. Tendons run from the strong muscles in our forearms, through the wrists and the fingers, to supply the power needed to climb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the tendons pass through the wrist and hand, they run through ligaments in our fingers called annular ligaments. Annular ligaments redirect the pull of the tendons to move our fingers. These ligaments are like the guides on a fishing pole that bend a rod when force is applied to the end of the fishing line. It’s the A2 and the A3 annular pulleys of your index, middle, and ring finger that are the most prone for damage when climbing. When griping with and open hand grip, there is very little pressure put on the pulleys in the fingers. When griping with a crimping grip, the fingers are put in danger.
When people start to climb, it can feel like there’s more strength using a crimp position. With practice, an open hand grip will feel more comfortable and strong. When you are climbing at your max, trying to get up a climb beyond your limits (which I strongly recommend you do to increase your skill), you will come across holds that you just need to crimp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you come across a hold you just can’t get with an open hand grip, try to use a grip half way between a crimp an open hand. When in a full crimp grip you can take a little force off your tendons and ligaments in your finger by placing your thumb on top of your index finger to add a little extra strength and support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes a long time to develop climbing skill. Some people will start out doing 5.8 and 5.9 while others will start with 5.4 and 5.5. No matter where you start, anyone can end up climbing the 5.11’s and 5.12’s, it just takes time, effort, and patience.
Regardless of how long you have been climbing or your skill level, your muscles will develop strength faster than your tendons and ligaments. You can easily increase your climbing power in a few months to a level that your ligaments and tendons can’t handle, which can lead to tendinitis, sprains, pulley injuries, and many other very uncomfortable problems that will put your climbing on hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So take your time. Train hard but be smart. Push your limits but not all day. Once you start feeling pain in your fingers, go down a grade or two or stop your session and stretch out. Don’t keep pulling on that crimp over and over again; you can come back to it in a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Epsom Salt Bath </title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Because of the high magnesium content, Epsom salts bath can be helpful any time you are suffering from&lt;a href=&quot;/generalmassagetherapy/what-can-deep-tissue-massage-treat/index.html&quot;&gt; muscle achiness or strain&lt;/a&gt;. Please set aside 40 minutes and run a full bath, the temperature of the water should be as hot as you can comfortably tolerate (though please do not exceed 40 degrees Celsius). Place the Epsom salt bath crystals into the water and spend at least 20 minutes soaking and relaxing. &amp;lt;/br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/br&amp;gt;

Keeping your neck and shoulder in the water as much as possible will allow the salts to work directly on the problematic muscles. This is also a great time to enjoy a glass of cold water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a diagnosed heart condition or are over the age of 50, please moderate the water temperature and avoid submerging yourself in hot water above the heart. If you have any concerns about whether a hot Epsom salt bath will affect you adversely, please contact your family physician before using an Epsom salts bath.&lt;/p&gt;
