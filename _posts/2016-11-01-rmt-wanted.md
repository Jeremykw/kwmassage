<p><a href="{{site.url}}/index.html">KWmassage</a> is a busy independent massage therapy practice opperated by me, <a href="{{site.url}}/about/index.html">Jeremy Bissonnette</a>, I am interested in having another massage therapist share the office with me.</p>

<p><a href="{{site.url}}/clinic-information/clinic/index.html">The office</a> is one block from the courthouse and region buildings and only a few buildings from the Lancaster and Frederick street intersection; a great location. It's beautifully finished with hardwood trim, vault ceilings, built in cabinetry, gas fireplace and crown moulding; it's really a great working environment. The space is fully furnished with an electric table, office workstation and everything else needed to run a successful massage therapy practice.</p>

<p>The ideal person would be willing to work into the evenings and on Saturdays. Some referrals are possible. Flat Rate or Percentage Split options are both possible.</p>

<p>If you're interested in discussing this opportunity further call Jeremy at <strong>519-745-4112</strong> or email <a href="mailto:Jeremy@kwmassage.com">Jeremy@kwmassage.com</a></p>
