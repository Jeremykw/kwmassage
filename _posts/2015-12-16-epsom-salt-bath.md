<p>Because of the high magnesium content, Epsom salts bath can be helpful any time you are suffering from<a href="{{site.url}}/generalmassagetherapy/what-can-deep-tissue-massage-treat/index.html"> muscle achiness or strain</a>. Please set aside 40 minutes and run a full bath, the temperature of the water should be as hot as you can comfortably tolerate (though please do not exceed 40 degrees Celsius). Place the Epsom salt bath crystals into the water and spend at least 20 minutes soaking and relaxing. </br></br>

Keeping your neck and shoulder in the water as much as possible will allow the salts to work directly on the problematic muscles. This is also a great time to enjoy a glass of cold water.</p>

<p>If you have a diagnosed heart condition or are over the age of 50, please moderate the water temperature and avoid submerging yourself in hot water above the heart. If you have any concerns about whether a hot Epsom salt bath will affect you adversely, please contact your family physician before using an Epsom salts bath.</p>
