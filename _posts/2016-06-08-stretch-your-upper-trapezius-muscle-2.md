<p>To <a href="{{site.url}}/stretching/general-guidelines-for-stretching/index.html">stretch</a> your <a href="{{site.url}}/generalmassagetherapy/tension-headaches-3/index.html">Upper Trapezius Muscle, </a>begin in a seated position.With your shoulders relaxed and your head in a natural position, carefully bend your neck to bring your right ear toward your right armpit. If more pressure is needed to feel the <a href="{{site.url}}/stretching/general-guidelines-for-stretching/index.html">stretch</a>, you can use your right hand to gently pull from the side of your head just above your left ear toward your right armpit.

<p>Be careful not to allow your left shoulder to rise, as this will prevent the muscle from lengthening into a stretched position. Repeat on the other side.</p>

<p>Be sure to review to my <a href="{{site.url}}/stretching/general-guidelines-for-stretching/index.html">General Guidelines for stretching </a>before doing any of the stretches I demonstrate and recommend. Itâ€™s always a good idea to see a <a href="{{site.url}}/generalmassagetherapy/governance-of-massage-therapy/index.html">health care professional </a>before starting a new exercise program.</p>
