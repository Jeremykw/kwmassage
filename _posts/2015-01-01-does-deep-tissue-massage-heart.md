<p>Often <a title="Deep tissue massage therapy" href="{{site.url}}/generalmassagetherapy/what-is-deep-tissue-massage/index.html">Deep Tissue massage therapy</a> will cause some tenderness when <a title="Jeremy, massage therapist in Kitchener" href="{{site.url}}/about/index.html">your massage therapist</a> is working hard to work out the tension, scar tissue, and trigger points from your muscles and ligaments. And yes, sometimes you will feel a little stiffness the day after. Most often, this soreness is <a title="welcome" href="{{site.url}}/index.html">welcome</a> relief as your therapist has the skill to pinpoint the source of your pain and work it out.
