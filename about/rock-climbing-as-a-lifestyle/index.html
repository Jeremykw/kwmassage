<p>I started rock climbing in 1997 when I was 21 years old. I started <a href="http://www.grandriverrocks.com/Pages/Home.aspx">climbing in the gym </a>before I ventured outside top-roping and sport climbing a year later. Now I’m a dad, a husband, and a <a href="{{site.url}}/index.html">massage therapist, </a>but I still love to climb and I plan to climb for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>My step-brother introduced me to gym climbing when I was 21 and I fell in love right away. It was like I had finally found the answer to the meaning of my life. As I started venturing outside top-roping then sport climbing, everything else in my life started to fade away. I slowly phased out my mountain biking and quit karate and ju-jitsu. I brought <a href="{{site.url}}/about/index.html">yoga</a> into my life a few years later, only because a friend and climbing partner suggested that it would help improve my climbing. I have had to take time off from my climbing; moving around, <a href="{{site.url}}/rock_climbing/rock-climbers-and-our-fingers/index.html">injuries</a>, <a href="{{site.url}}/generalmassagetherapy/facts-about-registered-massage-therapy-in-ontario/index.html">massage therapy school, </a>and babies have all taken me away from climbing for periods of time, but I have always come back to it.</p>

<p>Now that <a href="{{site.url}}/about/index.html">I’m a family man, </a>my climbing focus has changed. I spend a lot of time teaching my children to climb, and I help and encourage my wife to improve her climbing skills and experience. I take the whole family up multi-pitch trad climbs and we do day trips up to Rattle Snake Point to top-rope. My youngest daughter was four when we did our first family trip up to <a href="http://www.alpineclubofcanada.ca/facility/bon_echo.html">Bon Echo National park</a>, a 300 foot multi-pitch trad climb craig.</p>

<p>I do get out climbing without my family as well. I <a href="{{site.url}}/rock_climbing/aerobic-vs-anaerobic-training-for-rock-climbing/index.html">train once or twice a week </a>at <a href="http://www.grandriverrocks.com/Pages/Home.aspx">Grand River Rock</a>, and I get out to Mount Nemo a few times a year. I’ve been up to Bon Echo a handful of times. When I’m climbing with my family, I’m patient, encouraging, and methodical. When I’m out with the boys we like to climb hard and push our limits.</p>

<p>My training as a <a href="{{site.url}}/clinic-information/index.html">massage therapist </a>has been a great help to my climbing. When I injure myself, I know what to do to get myself back climbing as quick as possible. I know right away if I should use heat or ice, when to stretch, or rest, or just push through. It used to take me a week or more to get a solid answer about how to handle an injury, now I start with the right course of treatment right away. Even more importantly, I know what to do to stay healthy and reduce the risk of injuring myself. <a href="{{site.url}}/category/stretching/index.html">Proper stretching</a>, training supporting muscles, better posture, proper rest periods, and hydrotherapy all keep me strong, flexible, and limber to me keep climbing and training hard.</p>

<p>I find that my <a href="{{site.url}}/generalmassagetherapy/note-to-new-massage-therapy-clients/index.html">massage therapy clients </a>who also rock climb gain specific benefits. Not only have I experienced many of the injuries a climber would come in and seek treatment for, but I have also done the research for my own climbing injuries so I’m up to date regarding the latest medical treatment options and techniques.</p>

<p>I also know the lingo. I know what a crimp is, I know what a jug is and I know the dynamics of a layback and roof climbing. Communicating the specifics of an injury is often difficult between a client and their therapist. Trying to describe a climbing injury to a hockey player is like speaking a different language, and vice versa. I have experience with many different clients with many different injuries related to many different sports and professions but it’s the climbers that I know understand the best.</p>

<p>Climbing has been part of my life for a long time. It has permeated the rest of my life, family, and work. I might not be the best climber but I have a good amount of experience and have a lot of fun with it. I hope to continue growing my climbing experience, and I hope to share my knowledge by helping as many people as I can with their own climbing.</p>
