I"Ê<p>Massage therapy is a <a href="https://www.kwmassage.com/knowledge-centre/facts-about-registered-massage-therapy-in-ontario/index.html">regulated health profession</a>. The <a href="https://www.cmto.com/">College of Massage Therapist of Ontario </a>(CMTO) is the governing board that oversees and regulates <a href="https://www.kwmassage.com/index.html">massage therapists in Ontario</a>. If you have any questions related to the governance of massage therapy in Ontario, &lt;a href="https://www.cmto.com/"&lt;/a&gt; is a great resource.

<p>The 'Registered Massage Therapists Association of Ontario'(RMTAO) is the association that supports <a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Kitchener+Massage+Therapy/@43.4607924,-80.4512195,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x882bf4946918d4f9:0x3b65b74844c27bd2!8m2!3d43.4607924!4d-80.4490308" target="_blank">registered massage therapists</a> in Ontario. They lobby the government on behalf of all massage therapists in Ontario. They are the association that fought to get massage therapy into the Regulated Health Professionals Act (RHPA). Massage therapy being part of the RHPA is what allows you to have <a href="https://www.kwmassage.com/knowledge-centre/facts-about-registered-massage-therapy-in-ontario/index.html">massage therapy coverage </a>in your extended health benefits plan. The RMTAO did their best to avoid the new Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) from affecting the rate of massage therapy in Ontario. The RMTAO is a great education resource.</p>

<p>TheÂ RMTAO also has a sister website <a href="http://www.rmtfind.com/">RMTfind.com</a> that will allow you to search by <a href="https://www.kwmassage.com/contact/index.html">location for a massage therapist </a>in your area.</p>
