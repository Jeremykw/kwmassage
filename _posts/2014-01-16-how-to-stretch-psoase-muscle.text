<p>The Psoas muscle is a strong muscle at the front of your hip. It often affects your <a href="{{site.url}}/generalmassagetherapy/back-pain-and-how-to-massage-at-home">low back</a> and an cause pain. If you sit for long periods of time, be sure to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtnQHieEkqQ">stretch the Psoas muscle </a>often. </br></br>Be sure to review to my <a href="{{site.url}}/stretching/general-guidelines-for-stretching">General Guidelines for stretching </a>before doing any of the stretches I demonstrate or recommend. Itâ€™s always a good idea to see a <a href="{{site.url}}/generalmassagetherapy/governance-of-massage-therapy">health care professional</a> before starting a new exercise program.
