I"ò<p>Iâ€™m not the kind of <a href="https://www.kwmassage.com/index.html">massage therapist</a> that plays nature sounds, new age music, or any of the other typical spa-type music for <a href="https://www.kwmassage.com/clinic-information/note-to-new-massage-therapy-clients/index.html">my clients</a> while Iâ€™m working. My primary goal as a massage therapist is not relaxation; relaxation is a side effect of my style of therapy and sometimes sleep does come for some of my less rested clients. Iâ€™m more concerned with your muscular dysfunction; I donâ€™t feel I need to play music thatâ€™s going to put you to sleep. This doesnâ€™t mean I play punk or heavy metal; youâ€™re likely to hear anything from jazz and classical to folk or blues music.
