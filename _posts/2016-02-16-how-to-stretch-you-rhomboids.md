<p>Your Rhomboids are muscles in between your shoulder blades. They often get sore and stiff from working at a computer with poor posture. If you need to stretch your Rhomboids, be sure to stretch your pectoral muscles as well.

<p>If you are getting pain in your upper back, please see your <a href="{{site.url}}/about/index.html">local massage therapist</a> or other healthcare professional.</p>

<p>Be sure to review to my <a href="{{site.url}}/stretching/general-guidelines-for-stretching/index.html">General Guidelines for stretching</a> before doing any of the stretches I demonstrate and recommend. Itâ€™s always a good idea to see a <a href="{{site.url}}/generalmassagetherapy/governance-of-massage-therapy/index.html">health care professional</a> before starting a new exercise program.</p>
