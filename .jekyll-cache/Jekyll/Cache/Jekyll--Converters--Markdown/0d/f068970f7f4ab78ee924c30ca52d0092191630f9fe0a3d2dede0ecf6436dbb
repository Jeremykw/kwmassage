I"¬<p>Degeneration of the vertebral discs is a natural process as a person ages. The discs undergo slow wear and tear over many years, as a side effect of normal daily stresses. As this process continues the size and shape of the discs change, the discs loose vertical height, therefore leading to less space between each vertebra. Though not always symptomatic, Degenerative Disc Disease(DDD) can cause acute or chronic pain.</p>
