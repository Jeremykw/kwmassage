My first clients came to me because of back pain. Over the years, I have found that the overall outcome of <a href=/generalmassagetherapy/what-is-deep-tissue-massage/index.html>massage therapy treatments</a>for back pain has as much to do with the client as it does the <a href=/about/index.html>massage therapist</a>. The more a client is willing to do on their own, the better their recovery will be. If a client is willing to do the <a href=/stretching/general-guidelines-for-stretching/index.html>stretches</a>, exercises, and other home care recommended by their massage therapist, they get better sooner.</p><p>II often recommend stretching and strengthening exercises to enhance my massage therapy treatments. I also recommend <a href=/generalmassagetherapy/epsom-salt-bath/index.html>hot and/or cold applications</a>a lot, depending on the injury.</p><p>One thing I don’t talk much about in my <a title=clinic href=/clinic-information/index.html>clinic</a> is how to massage at home. I assume that a client will come into see me as often as necessary until they have recovered, so it isn’t beneficial to take the time to teach them how to massage at home. However, sometimes a client can’t see me as often as they would like. Under these situations, it can be very helpful to learn the basics of how to massage yourself, or someone else, at home. You can apply this information to any part of the body. Today, I’m going to focus on back pain.</p><p>The trick to a successful massage consists of 3 basic principles:<ol class=leftmargin><li>general – specific – general</li><li>superficial – deep – superficial</li><li>slowly warm and soften the tissue you want to work on.</li></ol>Always follow these 3 principles when doing massage on yourself or anyone else.</p><p>When massaging, I never dive right in and start treating the injured tissue directly right away. It’s important to always start broadly (general) and lightly (superficial). Gently work the muscles and tissues around the injury first. Once the general area is starting to soften and warm up, you can SLOWLY work your way in towards the muscles you are trying to affect. Once you are working directly on an injured muscle, it’s important that you use slow, firm pressure along the length of the muscle. After about 2 minutes of direct work, or until you feel the muscle start to soften, it’s time to slowly start working your way back out to the superficial and general areas around the injury.</p><p>I Always start and end a massage treatment with gentle pressure. Never try to achieve the same pressure that a <a href=/generalmassagetherapy/governance-of-massage-therapy/index.html>trained massage therapist</a>uses, you are likely to hurt the person you are working on as well as yourself. It takes a lot of time to develop the strength and control to do <a title="What is Deep Tissue Massage?" href=/generalmassagetherapy/what-is-deep-tissue-massage/index.html>deep tissue therapy</a>.</p><p>It can be helpful to talk to your massage therapist about the injury you want to treat at home. Often the <a title="Trigger Points and Trigger Point Therapy" href=/generalmassagetherapy/trigger-points-and-trigger-point-therapy/index.html>pain is coming from a different part of the body than you might think</a>, and having a professional massage therapist help you locate the right area to work on can be helpful. He/she can also guide you with technique, anatomy, and help you confirm that there aren’t any contraindications for the style of massage you want to do.</p><p>When working on yourself, it can be hard to reach your back. Start with a hot pack to soften and relax the muscles. Then, there are a number of ways to reach those sore and hard-to-reach areas:<ul class=leftmargin><li>lean into the corner of a wall using the edge on the muscle on either side of the spine</li><li>lie on a rolled towel and move around until you reach the right area</li><li>lie on a tennis ball on the floor to massage your own back</li></ul></p><p></p>...<a title="Read More" href="/generalmassagetherapy/back-pain-and-how-to-massage-at-home/">read more...</a><p></p><p></p><h4>Kitchener Massage Therapist makes another Rock Climbing Trip</h4><div class=date>16 Jan 2014</div><p>This Saturday my family and I are leaving for a <a href=/about/rock-climbing-as-a-lifestyle/index.html>rock climbing</a>trip and vacation.

The short answer is because <a href=/generalmassagetherapy/what-is-deep-tissue-massage/index.html target=_self>Deep Tissue</a>is the style of massage that I get done on myself and it works for me. It is a straight-forward style of massage where you can <a href=/generalmassagetherapy/does-deep-tissue-massage-heart/index.html>feel the work being done</a> and tell that it will make a difference right away.</p>...<a title="Read More" href="/generalmassagetherapy/why-does-jeremy-choose-to-practice-deep-tissue-massage/">read more...</a><p></p><p></p><h4>Climber’s Elbow</h4><div class=date>16 Jan 2014</div><p>I have seen a lot of my climbers come back into the <a title="Massage Therapy Clinic Contact Info" href=/contact/index.html>clinic</a> recently. After a full summer of hard climbing, I guess the body needs a little help. I have also seen a few new climber clients come out of the <a title="kitchener Local Climbing gym" href="http://grandriverrocks.com/">climbing gym</a> in the past few months, all suffering from tendonitis at the outside of the elbow (known as lateral epicondylitis, tennis elbow, or climber’s elbow for rock climbers).</p><p>I believe this is happening because the grip strength needed for climbing over-develops the muscles on the front side of the forearm while no extra strength is developed on the back side of the forearm. After a few months of regular climbing (once a week or more) a substantial imbalance can develop. With all this extra force pulling the wrist forward all the time the back side has that much more work to do to perform daily tasks such as using a mouse and keyboard, swinging a hammer, or pulling files out of a filing cabinet. If you do any task that uses the back side of the forearm repetitively in your work or studies, and have such a strength imbalance, you are increasing your chances of getting climber’s elbow.</p><p>The best thing climbers can do is to proactively avoid the imbalance altogether before experiencing pain. It’s not necessary to stop climbing altogether, but to perform regular exercises to strengthen the back side of the forearm before or after every climbing session.</p><p>Posterior wrist curls are a great option. My favorite option to strengthen and rebalance is to wrap a cord or rope around a piece of broom handle or something similar and tie the other end to a weight of some kind. You would then alternate rolling the wrists to rotate to broom handle to raise and lower the wrists.</p><p>If you are already starting to experience pain at the outside of your elbow or in your forearm, it’s important to seek professional help. A <a title="Kitchener Waterloo Massage Therapist" href=/about/index.html>massage therapist</a>or physical therapist is your best option. You need more specific guidance regarding exercises as well as some hands-on manual therapy.</p><p>If you catch it quickly enough, you might be able to stop it from progressing by taking a few weeks off climbing while slowly improving the strength balance in your forearm. Left untreated, climber’s elbow (tennis elbow) can worsen quickly and take you out of climbing for much longer.</p>...<a title="Read More" href="/rock_climbing/climbers-elbow-2/">read more...</a><p></p><p></p><h4>Rock Climbers and Our Fingers</h4><div class=date>16 Jan 2014</div><p>Our fingers are some of our smallest extremities. <a title="Rock Climbing Articles" href=/knowledge-centre/rock-climbing/index.html>Rock climbers</a> put tremendous strain on their fingers, which can encourage an injury. It’s important to understand the anatomy of the hand and fingers to see what we can do to decrease the risk of climbing injury, and to also have a look at what to do if a finger injury happens.</p><p>Our fingers have no muscles, and our hands only have small muscles meant for fine, controlled movement; those hand muscles aren't meant for the powerful explosive force needed for <a title="Rock Climbing as a Lifestyle" href=/about/rock-climbing-as-a-lifestyle/index.html>rock climbing</a>. The energy needed for rock climbing comes from the forearms instead. Tendons run from the strong muscles in our forearms, through the wrists and the fingers, to supply the power needed to climb.</p><p>After the tendons pass through the wrist and hand, they run through ligaments in our fingers called annular ligaments. Annular ligaments redirect the pull of the tendons to move our fingers. These ligaments are like the guides on a fishing pole that bend a rod when force is applied to the end of the fishing line. It’s the A2 and the A3 annular pulleys of your index, middle, and ring finger that are the most prone for damage when climbing. When griping with and open hand grip, there is very little pressure put on the pulleys in the fingers. When griping with a crimping grip, the fingers are put in danger. When people start to climb, it can feel like there’s more strength using a crimp position. With practice, an open hand grip will feel more comfortable and strong. When you are climbing at your max, trying to get up a climb beyond your limits (which I strongly recommend you do to increase your skill), you will come across holds that you just need to crimp.</p><p>When you come across a hold you just can’t get with an open hand grip, try to use a grip half way between a crimp an open hand. When in a full crimp grip you can take a little force off your tendons and ligaments in your finger by placing your thumb on top of your index finger to add a little extra strength and support.</p><p>It takes a long time to develop climbing skill. Some people will start out doing 5.8 and 5.9 while others will start with 5.4 and 5.5. No matter where you start, anyone can end up climbing the 5.11’s and 5.12’s, it just takes time, effort, and patience. Regardless of how long you have been climbing or your skill level, your muscles will develop strength faster than your tendons and ligaments. You can easily increase your climbing power in a few months to a level that your ligaments and tendons can’t handle, which can lead to tendinitis, sprains, pulley injuries, and many other very uncomfortable problems that will put your climbing on hold.</p><p>So take your time. Train hard but be smart. Push your limits but not all day. Once you start feeling pain in your fingers, go down a grade or two or stop your session and stretch out. Don’t keep pulling on that crimp over and over again; you can come back to it in a few days.</p>...<a title="Read More" href="/rock_climbing/rock-climbers-and-our-fingers/">read more...</a><p></p><div class=pagination><p><a href="/knowledge-centre/" class=previous>Previous</a> <b class=page_number>Page: 2 of 4</b> <a href="/knowledge-centre/page/3/" class=next>Next</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sidebar nobottommargin clearfix" data-class-sm=noleftpadding><div class="sidebar-widgets-wrap slider-caption-bg slider-caption-bg-light" data-class-lg data-class-md data-class-sm=sidebar_sm data-class-xs data-class-xxs><div class="widget clearfix"><div class=clearfix></div><div style="margin-right: 0px;" class="row rates_no_margin" data-class-xxs=center><h3>Hours</h3><div style="text-align: left; margin-left: 25px; width: 70px;" class="col_half norightmargin inline-block"><strong>Monday</strong><br><strong>Tuesday</strong><br><strong>Wednesday</strong><br><strong>Thursday</strong><br><strong>Friday</strong><br><strong>Saturday</strong><br><strong>Sunday</strong><br></div><div style="text-align: right; width: 90px;" class="col_half fright col_last norightmargin noleftmargin">10:00 - 5:00<br>10:00 - 7:30<br>10:00 - 5:00<br>10:00 - 3:00<br>10:00 - 3:00<br>Closed<br>Closed<br></div></div><div style="margin-right: 0px;" class="row rates_no_margin" data-class-xxs=center><h3>Rates</h3><div class="col_half norightmargin inline-block" data-class-lg=ratebox data-class-md=ratebox data-class-sm=ratebox data-class-xs=ratebox data-class-xxs=ratebox_xxs><strong>1/2 Hour</strong><br><strong>1 Hour</strong><br><strong>1.5 Hour</strong><br></div><div style="text-align: right; width: 80px;" class="col_half fright col_last norightmargin noleftmargin">$65<br>$95<br>$130<br></div></div><div class=clearfix></div><div><a href=/clinic-information/index.html title="Schedule Massage Therapy Appointment Now" style="margin: 10px" class="btn btn-danger fright">Schedule Now</a></div><div class=clearfix></div><div class="testimonial bottommargin-sm"><a href="http://www.cmto.com/" target=_blank title="College of Massage Therapists of Ontario"><img alt="College of Massage Therapists of Ontario" class=attachment-200x105 style="max-width: 100%;" src=/assets/images/cmto-logo.jpg></a></div><div class="testimonial bottommargin-sm"><a href="http://www.rmtao.com/" target=_blank class=widget_sp_image-image-link title="Registered Massage Therapists Association of Ontario"><img alt="Registered Massage Therapists Association of Ontario" class=attachment-full style="max-width: 100%;" src=/assets/images/rmtao_logo_english_lead.gif></a></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><footer id=footer class=dark style="background: url('/images/footer-bg.jpg'); background-size: 100% 100%;"><div class="container clearfix"><div class=footer-widgets-wrap><div class=col_one_third><div class="widget quick-contact-widget"><h4>Send Message</h4><div id=footer-contact-form-result data-notify-type=success data-notify-msg="<i class=icon-ok-sign></i> Message Sent Successfully!"></div><form id=footer-contact-form name=footer-contact-form action=/include/footercontact.php method=post class=nobottommargin><div class=form-process></div><div class="input-group divcenter"><span class=input-group-addon><i class=icon-user></i></span> <input type=text class="required form-control input-block-level" id=footer-contact-form-name name=footer-contact-form-name placeholder="Full Name"></div><div class="input-group divcenter"><span class=input-group-addon><i class=icon-email2></i></span> <input type=text class="required form-control email input-block-level" id=footer-contact-form-email name=footer-contact-form-email placeholder="Email Address"></div><textarea class="required form-control input-block-level short-textarea" id=footer-contact-form-message name=footer-contact-form-message rows=4 cols=30 placeholder=Message></textarea> <input type=text class=hidden id=footer-contact-form-botcheck name=footer-contact-form-botcheck> <button type=submit id=footer-contact-form-submit name=footer-contact-form-submit class="btn btn-danger fright nomargin" value=submit>Send Email</button></form><script type=text/javascript>
