I"1<p>I have been treating <a href="http://localhost:4000/stretching/low-back-pain/index.html">back pain</a> successfully since 2005. My first clients came to me because of back pain. Over the years, I have found that the overall outcome of <a href="http://localhost:4000/generalmassagetherapy/what-is-deep-tissue-massage/index.html">massage therapy treatments </a>for back pain has as much to do with the client as it does the <a href="http://localhost:4000/about/index.html">massage therapist</a>. The more a client is willing to do on their own, the better their recovery will be. If a client is willing to do the <a href="http://localhost:4000/stretching/general-guidelines-for-stretching/index.html">stretches</a>, exercises, and other home care recommended by their massage therapist, they get better sooner.
