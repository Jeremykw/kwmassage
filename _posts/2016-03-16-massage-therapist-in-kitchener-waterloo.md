<p>You might have noticed that there are over 300 <a href="https://plus.google.com/+Kwmassage" target="_blank">Registered Massage Therapists </a>in the Kitchener- Waterloo area. This is due mainly to the fact that one of the major massage therapy schools, the <a href="http://www.collegeofmassage.com/cambridge/">Canadian College of Massage and Hydrotherapy </a>is located in Kitchener. This high volume of massage therapists means higher competition between massage therapists. It also means higher levels of service for you, the massage therapy client. <a href="{{site.url}}/about/index.html">Your massage therapist </a>needs to be good to stand out and attract clients.

</p>

<p>With so many registered Massage Therapists in Kitchener-Waterloo, there is no reason you shouldn’t be 100% happy with yours. Don’t be discouraged and don’t feel obligated to rebook or go back if you’re not happy with your new massage therapist. When you are happy, your therapist will appreciate the loyalty.</p>

<p>There are many therapists trying to set themselves apart from the others by learning and using new styles of <a href="{{site.url}}/clinic-information/index.html">massage therapy</a>. There are a lot of styles available for a massage therapist to learn, some of these more effective than others. Don’t be surprised to find your new massage therapist practicing a technique you weren’t expecting. This is fine; for every massage therapy client there is a massage therapist and a different style of massage.</p>

<p>Since there are over 300 massage therapist in Kitchener and Waterloo, <a href="{{site.url}}/contact">don’t be afraid to try a new one</a>. Do your research, check out massage therapists online, read reviews on <a href="http://www.yelp.ca/biz/kitchener-massage-therapy-kitchener">Yelp</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/profile/edit?trk=hb_tab_pro_top">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/KWmassage/354131367967709">FaceBook</a> and <a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps/place?rlz=1I7DDCA_en&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;redir_esc=&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=kitchener+massage+therapy&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=ca&amp;hq=massage+therapy&amp;hnear=Kitchener,+ON&amp;cid=4280028541904649170&amp;ei=R2DATcqiM4WltwfcjeWxBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local_result&amp;ct=map-marker-link&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEAQrwswAA">Google Places</a>, call around and ask <a href="{{site.url}}/generalmassagetherapy/what-is-deep-tissue-massage">what type of massage </a>a potential therapist offers. See if they have experience dealing with what you need help with most. Personality also goes a long way, though I think you will find most massage therapist are easy to get along with.</p>
