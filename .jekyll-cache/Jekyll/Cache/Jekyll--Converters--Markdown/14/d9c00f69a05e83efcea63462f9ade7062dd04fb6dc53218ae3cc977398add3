If more pressure is needed to feel the <a href="http://localhost:4000/stretching/general-guidelines-for-stretching/index.html">stretch</a>, you can use your right hand to gently pull from the side of your head just above your left ear toward your right armpit.</p>

<p>Be careful not to allow your left shoulder to rise, as this will prevent the muscle from lengthening into a stretched position. Repeat on the other side.</p>
