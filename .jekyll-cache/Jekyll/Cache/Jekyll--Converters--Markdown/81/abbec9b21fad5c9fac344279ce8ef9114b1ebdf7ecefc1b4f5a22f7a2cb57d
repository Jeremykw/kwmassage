I"§<p>With so many types of massage to provide to clients, why do I choose to provide <a href="http://localhost:4000/generalmassagetherapy/what-is-deep-tissue-massage/index.html">Deep Tissue Massage</a>? The short answer is because <a href="http://localhost:4000/generalmassagetherapy/what-is-deep-tissue-massage/index.html" target="_self">Deep Tissue </a>is the style of massage that I get done on myself and it works for me. It is a straight-forward style of massage where you can <a href="http://localhost:4000/generalmassagetherapy/does-deep-tissue-massage-heart/index.html">feel the work being done</a> and tell that it will make a difference right away.

</p>

<p>Before I became a massage therapist, I was a <a href="http://localhost:4000/clinic-information/index.html">massage therapy client</a>. Even before I started studying massage at the <a href="https://collegeofmassage.com/cambridge/">Canadian College of Massage and Hydrotherapy in Kitchener, </a>I was seeing Kevin Heeney, a Deep Tissue massage therapist in Kitchener. I got great results with the work Kevin did on me. In fact, Kevin is part of the reason that I became a massage therapist and has been a mentor to me ever since (though I donâ€™t think he realizes it). Any time I have injured my back or neck at work, rock climbing, playing with the kids, or working in the backyard, Kevin has been there for me. I canâ€™t see myself wanting to do anything for my clients other than what Kevin does for me.
I am a <a href="http://localhost:4000/about/index.html">deep tissue therapist </a>and a deep tissue massage client because it works for me and for my <a href="http://localhost:4000/clinic-information/index.html">clients</a>.</p>
