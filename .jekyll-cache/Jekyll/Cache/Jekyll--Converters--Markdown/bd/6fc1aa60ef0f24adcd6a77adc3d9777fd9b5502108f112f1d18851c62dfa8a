I" <p>Because of the high magnesium content, Epsom salts bath can be helpful any time you are suffering from<a href="http://localhost:4000/generalmassagetherapy/what-can-deep-tissue-massage-treat/index.html"> muscle achiness or strain</a>. Please set aside 40 minutes and run a full bath, the temperature of the water should be as hot as you can comfortably tolerate (though please do not exceed 40 degrees Celsius). Place the Epsom salt bath crystals into the water and spend at least 20 minutes soaking and relaxing. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
