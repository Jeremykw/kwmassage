<a title="Kitchener Massage Therapy Welcome Video" href="http://youtu.be/XSRrvEXZSdk" target="_blank" rel="http://youtu.be/XSRrvEXZSdk"><img class=" wp-image-155 alignleft" alt="Jeremy Bissonnette, Registered Massage Therapist" src="{{site.baseurl}}/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/img_video-300x276.gif" width="240" height="221" /></a>I graduated with Honours from the <a href="http://www.collegeofmassage.com/cambridge/">Canadian College of Massage and Hydrotherapy </a>in 2005 as a <a href="http://www.cmto.com/">Registered Massage Therapist </a>(RMT). I’ve practiced massage therapy in Kitchener and Waterloo in a variety of locations in including a home practice, the <a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/hpc/">University of Guelph’s Health and Performance Center, </a>and most recently, in an independently owned chiropractic office. I have also provided chair treatments at the <a href="http://www.kitchenermarket.ca/">Kitchener Market </a>on a monthly basis in the past.

My massage therapy treatment style has been focused around <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/deleteme/what-is-deep-tissue-massage">Deep Tissue Therapy </a>with an emphasis on helping clients learn to care for their own bodies. I have practiced yoga for the past 10 years and find my clients respond well to my recommendations around specific yoga asana and stretches to help with the different ailments they need to address. I find my knowledge of anatomy helps create clarity on the yoga mat and I have an interest in sharing this experience.

<h2>My Personal World</h2>
My main focus in life is caring for my 2 daughters, Rowan (7) and Breanne (5). I’m busy getting kids fed, dressed, doing hair, making bread, doing homework and housework, planning a garden, and all the activities associated with being a parent. Being a dad can have its challenges but it is also very rewarding. I feel very lucky to be able to fill this role while my wife works full-time.

In my spare time, I enjoy <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/rock_climbing/rock-climbing-as-a-life-style">rock climbing</a>, yoga, reading, camping, and gardening. Prior to becoming a registered massage therapist, I used to work in a <a href="http://www.paramountsports.ca/">bike and snow board shop</a>, so when I can, I love to hit the hills and get back to my original roots.
