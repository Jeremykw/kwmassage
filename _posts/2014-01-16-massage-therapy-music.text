<p>I’m not the kind of <a href="{{site.url}}/">massage therapist</a> that plays nature sounds, new age music, or any of the other typical spa-type music for <a href="{{site.url}}/generalmassagetherapy/note-to-new-massage-therapy-clients">my clients</a> while I’m working. My primary goal as a massage therapist is not relaxation; relaxation is a side effect of my style of therapy and sometimes sleep does come for some of my less rested clients. I’m more concerned with your muscular dysfunction; I don’t feel I need to play music that’s going to put you to sleep. This doesn’t mean I play punk or heavy metal; you’re likely to hear anything from jazz and classical to folk or blues music.

90% of the time I play <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/radio2/">CBC Radio 2</a> in my massage therapy room. I’m in Kitchener Ontario so if you want to have a listen to what Radio 2 is playing now, check out the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/video/radio-popup.html#networkKey=cbc_radio_2&amp;programKey=eastern">eastern regional broadcast</a>. Radio 2 plays a whole range of music; classical, opera, jazz, folk, country, hip hop, blues… the list goes on. Every hour, on the hour, there is 5 minutes of world news, but I find this to be a small price to pay compared to radio commercials every 10-15 minutes. And hey -- it forces me to stay up to date on world events!

As a backup, for those times when the opera gets to be too much or the hip hop to loud for my client, I always have my MP3 player as a backup. I’ll often have music like: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5T3FXFnoTzE">Nina Simone</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCQDWjN22X0">Nora Jones</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWVnZAJaq4Q">Jack Jonson</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otJY2HvW3Bw">Lenard Cohen</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWdG8NoFXY0">U2</a> on hand.</p>
