I"¯<p>Itâ€™s May 16th and the weather in the Kitchener, Waterloo has been miserable. We had a few weeks of warmish weather but now we are right back to cold and rainy. You might ask why a <a href="http://localhost:4000/">massage therapist </a>would care about the weather. Itâ€™s been good for business, thatâ€™s why I care. Our muscles get tight and stiff, old pains come back to the surface, and new ones come out. When this happens, we need to see our massage therapist.

<p>Our bodyâ€™s main mechanism to create or retain heat is to increase our metabolism (the amount of food energy we burn). Our body does this by contracting our muscles. Notice how your shoulders rise up to your ears when you walk outside on a cold day without your jacket. Your legs, back, neck, shoulders, and all the muscles in your body will do this. This increase in muscle tension will increase stress on your joints, pull your body out of alignment, and create muscle imbalances. With this added stress to your body, many symptoms like<a href="http://localhost:4000/stretching/stretch-your-upper-trapezius-muscle/index.html"> neck pain</a>, <a href="http://localhost:4000/stretching/low-back-pain/index.html">back pain</a>, <a href="http://localhost:4000/generalmassagetherapy/tension-headaches-3/index.html">headaches</a>, and muscle achiness surface.</p>

<p>Seeing your massage therapist will help decrease this muscle tension and correct your muscle imbalances.</p>
