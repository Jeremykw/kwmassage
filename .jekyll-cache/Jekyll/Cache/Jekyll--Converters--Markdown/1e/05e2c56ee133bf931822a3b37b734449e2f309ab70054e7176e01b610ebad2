I"’<p>No, I do not charge an initial consultation fee for <a href="https://www.kwmassage.com/clinic-information/index.html">massage therapy treatments</a>. I have a simple one page <a title="Massage Therapy Health History Form" href="https://www.kwmassage.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Health-History.pdf">Health History form</a> for you to fill out, I take 5 minutes or so to go over this form inorder to get a general idea of what Iâ€™m treating before we begin. After reviewing your needs, we get started right away, any other information I need I can ask <a href="https://www.kwmassage.com/clinic-information/index.html">while Iâ€™m treating you</a>.
