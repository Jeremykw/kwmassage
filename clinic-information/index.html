	<p>One of the easiest ways for you to make an appointment with me at the clinic is to book one online! All you need to do is enter your name, date of birth and contact information then pick a time and day, in my scheduling service Cliniko. Scheduling an appointment online is fast, efficient, and easy.</p>

	<p><b>Step #1</b>: How long a massage do you want? You can have 30, 60, or 90 minutes of massage treatment time. The table below includes treatment rates. Click the link for the massage you need.</p>
	<p><b>Step #2</b>: Use the calendar to find an open time slot for your massage treatment. When you find an appointment time that works for you, click the link for that appointment.</p>
	<p><b>Step #3</b>: Enter your name, date of birth and contact information and leave me a note about your appointment if you wish.</p>
	<p><b>Step #4</b>: Review the details of your appointment. It’s easy to change the appointment details if needed. You can also send me a message. When you’re ready to book your massage treatment, click <strong>Book Appointment</strong>.</p>

	<p>You will receive an email confirmation of your appointment. If you don’t – please try rebooking or contact me directly .
	If you do not want to book online, please feel free to call me to book an appointment. Sometimes, if you are lucky, you might be able to get a last-minute appointment , or I may have additional time slots open that the scheduling tool doesn't.</p>
