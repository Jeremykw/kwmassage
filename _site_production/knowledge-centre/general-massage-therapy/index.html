  			<p>As many of you are already aware, restrictions were lifted earlier this week by our Provincial government for medical practitioners in healthcare fields such as Physiotherapy, Chiropractic, and Massage Therapy to allow us to reopen our practices. I will be slowly reopening my practice starting on June 8th.</p>

  			<p>I'm trying something new this month, I've brought in a product for resale. The <a href="https://acuball.com/product/dr-cohens-acuball/?affiliates=19" target="_blank" title="Acuball">Acuball</a> is something that has been floating around my house for a few years. It's something that I lean on regularly for my own aches and pains. And I often find myself recommending my clients go buy one somewhere else or use a lacrosse ball to achieve a similar effect. I feel that it will be helpful to keep a few in the clinic so that clients can take home exactly what I’m showing them. </p>

  			<h4>Degenerative Disc Disease</h4>
  			<div class="date">01 Nov 2018</div>
  			<p>Degeneration of the vertebral discs is a natural process as a person ages. The discs undergo slow wear and tear over many years, as a side effect of normal daily stresses. As this process continues the size and shape of the discs change, the discs loose vertical height, therefore leading to less space between each vertebra. Though not always symptomatic, Degenerative Disc Disease(DDD) can cause acute or chronic pain.</p>

  			<p>It’s May 16th and the weather in the Kitchener, Waterloo has been miserable. We had a few weeks of warmish weather but now we are right back to cold and rainy. You might ask why a <a href="https://www.kwmassage.com/">massage therapist </a>would care about the weather. It’s been good for business, that’s why I care. Our muscles get tight and stiff, old pains come back to the surface, and new ones come out. When this happens, we need to see our massage therapist.

This is due mainly to the fact that one of the major massage therapy schools, the <a href="https://www.collegeofmassage.com/cambridge/">Canadian College of Massage and Hydrotherapy </a>is located in Kitchener. This high volume of massage therapists means higher competition between massage therapists. It also means higher levels of service for you, the massage therapy client. <a href="https://www.kwmassage.com/about/index.html">Your massage therapist </a>needs to be good to stand out and attract clients.

  			<h4>Epsom Salt Bath </h4>

  			<p>Because of the high magnesium content, Epsom salts bath can be helpful any time you are suffering from<a href="https://www.kwmassage.com/generalmassagetherapy/what-can-deep-tissue-massage-treat/index.html"> muscle achiness or strain</a>. Please set aside 40 minutes and run a full bath, the temperature of the water should be as hot as you can comfortably tolerate (though please do not exceed 40 degrees Celsius). Place the Epsom salt bath crystals into the water and spend at least 20 minutes soaking and relaxing. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

  			<p>I have been treating <a href="https://www.kwmassage.com/stretching/low-back-pain/index.html">back pain</a> successfully since 2005. My first clients came to me because of back pain. Over the years, I have found that the overall outcome of <a href="https://www.kwmassage.com/generalmassagetherapy/what-is-deep-tissue-massage/index.html">massage therapy treatments </a>for back pain has as much to do with the client as it does the <a href="https://www.kwmassage.com/about/index.html">massage therapist</a>. The more a client is willing to do on their own, the better their recovery will be. If a client is willing to do the <a href="https://www.kwmassage.com/stretching/general-guidelines-for-stretching/index.html">stretches</a>, exercises, and other home care recommended by their massage therapist, they get better sooner.

  			<p>Deep Tissue massage is similar to the most common type of massage, Swedish massage, in that your therapist uses long, smooth, and kneading strokes to achieve healing changes in the body. The two forms of massage differ in that <a title="Discomfort of deep tissue massage" href="https://www.kwmassage.com/generalmassagetherapy/does-deep-tissue-massage-heart/index.html">Deep Tissue massage aims to affect the deeper structures of the body </a>and have a deeper level of healing.

My primary goal as a massage therapist is not relaxation; relaxation is a side effect of my style of therapy and sometimes sleep does come for some of my less rested clients. I’m more concerned with your muscular dysfunction; I don’t feel I need to play music that’s going to put you to sleep. This doesn’t mean I play punk or heavy metal; you’re likely to hear anything from jazz and classical to folk or blues music.

It is a straight-forward style of massage where you can <a href="https://www.kwmassage.com/generalmassagetherapy/does-deep-tissue-massage-heart/index.html">feel the work being done</a> and tell that it will make a difference right away.
