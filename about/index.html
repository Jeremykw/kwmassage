<h2 style="margin: 0 0 0 0">About Jeremy Bissonnette</h2>
<i>Registered Massage Therapist</i>

<p>I graduated with Honours from the <a href="http://www.collegeofmassage.com/cambridge/">Canadian College of Massage and Hydrotherapy </a>in 2005 as a <a href="http://www.cmto.com/">Registered Massage Therapist </a>(RMT). I’ve practiced massage therapy in Kitchener and Waterloo in a variety of locations in including a home practice, the <a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/hpc/">University of Guelph’s Health and Performance Center, </a>and most recently, in an independently owned chiropractic office. I have also provided chair treatments at the <a href="http://www.kitchenermarket.ca/">Kitchener Market </a>on a monthly basis in the past.

My massage therapy treatment style has been focused around <a href="{{site.url}}/deleteme/what-is-deep-tissue-massage/index.html">Deep Tissue Therapy </a>with an emphasis on helping clients learn to care for their own bodies. I have practiced yoga for the past 15 years and find my clients respond well to my recommendations around specific yoga postures and stretches to help with the different ailments they need to address.</p>

<h2>My Personal World</h2>
<p>My main focus in life is my 2 daughters, Rowan (11) and Breanne (9). When not at work I'm busy driving my girls to dance, gymnastics and school. In my spare time, I enjoy <a href="{{site.url}}/rock_climbing/rock-climbing-as-a-life-style/index.html">rock climbing</a>, yoga, reading, camping, and mountain biking. Prior to becoming a registered massage therapist, I used to work in a <a href="http://www.paramountsports.ca/">bike and snow board shop</a>, so when I can, I love to hit the hills and get back to my original roots.
