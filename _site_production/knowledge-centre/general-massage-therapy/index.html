I have registered <a href=/index.html>KWMassage</a> for a <a title="Book with KW Massage Online" href=https://kwmassage.cliniko.com/bookings#service target=_blank>CliniKo.com</a> account. Cliniko will allow me to take appointments online, control my schedule, record clinical notes, write receipts for my services and do my bookkeeping all within the same software system. The only change you will notice is the online scheduler will look and operate a little different and hopefully you will get better service.</p><p>Now instead of using Schedulicity to make and change appointments on my website you will be using Cliniko. I will replace the schedulicity software widget on the KWmassage website with the <a href=/clinic-information/index.html>Cliniko widget</a> so you will still have access to my calendar from the same location on the KWmassage website. There are only a few differences between the two systems. First Cliniko does not require you to have and remember a user name and password. You will now have to enter you name, date of birth and contact info instead. Cliniko will then match you to an existing client account or create a new one for you. The only drawback to Cliniko is that it will not enable you to cancel appointments yourself; you will need to contact me via email, text or phone. In the event that you want to change an appointment, simple make the new appointment then message me to delete the old one. I recognize that this may be a small inconvenience to some but hopefully not having to remember a user name and password and the huge improvement in my usability will be enough to balance this out. You will continue to get email reminders of your massage appointments from Cliniko.</p><p>Previously I used Outlook for communications and contact management, QuickBooks for receipts and bookkeeping, Business contact manager for clinical notes and Schedulicity for calendar and online appointments. Having four different programs managing four different aspect of information for one client was very redundant and cumbersome. I was doing a lot of quadruple entry, not only was this time consuming but it also created space or errors in data input. As well it certainly was not encouraging to stay on top of my paperwork.</p><p>My goal is to allow Cliniko to help me be more efficient, more accurate, more detailed and timelier with your clinical notes. This will make it easier for me to stay up to date and informed with your health history and offer you better care.</p>...<a title="Read More" href="/generalmassagetherapy/a-new-way-to-make-a-kw-massage-therapy-appointment/">read more...</a><p></p><p></p><h4>Epsom Salt Bath</h4><div class=date>16 Jan 2014</div><p>Because of the high magnesium content, Epsom salts bath can be helpful any time you are suffering from<a href=/generalmassagetherapy/what-can-deep-tissue-massage-treat/index.html>muscle achiness or strain</a>. Please set aside 40 minutes and run a full bath, the temperature of the water should be as hot as you can comfortably tolerate (though please do not exceed 40 degrees Celsius). Place the Epsom salt bath crystals into the water and spend at least 20 minutes soaking and relaxing. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; Keeping your neck and shoulder in the water as much as possible will allow the salts to work directly on the problematic muscles. This is also a great time to enjoy a glass of cold water.</p><p>If you have a diagnosed heart condition or are over the age of 50, please moderate the water temperature and avoid submerging yourself in hot water above the heart. If you have any concerns about whether a hot Epsom salt bath will affect you adversely, please contact your family physician before using an Epsom salts bath.</p>...<a title="Read More" href="/generalmassagetherapy/epsom-salt-bath/">read more...</a><p></p><p></p><h4>Does the Weather Make our Muscles Stiff?</h4><div class=date>16 Jan 2014</div><p>It’s May 16th and the weather in the Kitchener, Waterloo has been miserable. We had a few weeks of warmish weather but now we are right back to cold and rainy. You might ask why a <a href="/">massage therapist</a>would care about the weather. It’s been good for business, that’s why I care. Our muscles get tight and stiff, old pains come back to the surface, and new ones come out.

My primary goal as a massage therapist is not relaxation; relaxation is a side effect of my style of therapy and sometimes sleep does come for some of my less rested clients. I’m more concerned with your muscular dysfunction; I don’t feel I need to play music that’s going to put you to sleep. This doesn’t mean I play punk or heavy metal; you’re likely to hear anything from jazz and classical to folk or blues music.</p>...<a title="Read More" href="/generalmassagetherapy/massage-therapy-music/">read more...</a><p></p><p></p><h4>Do You Charge An Initial Consultation Fee For Massage Therapy Appointments?</h4><div class=date>16 Jan 2014</div><p>No, I do not charge an initial consultation fee for <a href=/clinic-information/index.html>massage therapy treatments</a>. I have a simple one page <a title="Massage Therapy Health History Form" href=/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Health-History.pdf>Health History form</a> for you to fill out, I take 5 minutes or so to go over this form inorder to get a general idea of what I’m treating before we begin.

My first clients came to me because of back pain. Over the years, I have found that the overall outcome of <a href=/generalmassagetherapy/what-is-deep-tissue-massage/index.html>massage therapy treatments</a>for back pain has as much to do with the client as it does the <a href=/about/index.html>massage therapist</a>. The more a client is willing to do on their own, the better their recovery will be. If a client is willing to do the <a href=/stretching/general-guidelines-for-stretching/index.html>stretches</a>, exercises, and other home care recommended by their massage therapist, they get better sooner.</p><p>II often recommend stretching and strengthening exercises to enhance my massage therapy treatments. I also recommend <a href=/generalmassagetherapy/epsom-salt-bath/index.html>hot and/or cold applications</a>a lot, depending on the injury.</p><p>One thing I don’t talk much about in my <a title=clinic href=/clinic-information/index.html>clinic</a> is how to massage at home. I assume that a client will come into see me as often as necessary until they have recovered, so it isn’t beneficial to take the time to teach them how to massage at home. However, sometimes a client can’t see me as often as they would like. Under these situations, it can be very helpful to learn the basics of how to massage yourself, or someone else, at home. You can apply this information to any part of the body. Today, I’m going to focus on back pain.</p><p>The trick to a successful massage consists of 3 basic principles:<ol class=leftmargin><li>general – specific – general</li><li>superficial – deep – superficial</li><li>slowly warm and soften the tissue you want to work on.</li></ol>Always follow these 3 principles when doing massage on yourself or anyone else.</p><p>When massaging, I never dive right in and start treating the injured tissue directly right away. It’s important to always start broadly (general) and lightly (superficial). Gently work the muscles and tissues around the injury first. Once the general area is starting to soften and warm up, you can SLOWLY work your way in towards the muscles you are trying to affect. Once you are working directly on an injured muscle, it’s important that you use slow, firm pressure along the length of the muscle. After about 2 minutes of direct work, or until you feel the muscle start to soften, it’s time to slowly start working your way back out to the superficial and general areas around the injury.</p><p>I Always start and end a massage treatment with gentle pressure. Never try to achieve the same pressure that a <a href=/generalmassagetherapy/governance-of-massage-therapy/index.html>trained massage therapist</a>uses, you are likely to hurt the person you are working on as well as yourself. It takes a lot of time to develop the strength and control to do <a title="What is Deep Tissue Massage?" href=/generalmassagetherapy/what-is-deep-tissue-massage/index.html>deep tissue therapy</a>.</p><p>It can be helpful to talk to your massage therapist about the injury you want to treat at home. Often the <a title="Trigger Points and Trigger Point Therapy" href=/generalmassagetherapy/trigger-points-and-trigger-point-therapy/index.html>pain is coming from a different part of the body than you might think</a>, and having a professional massage therapist help you locate the right area to work on can be helpful. He/she can also guide you with technique, anatomy, and help you confirm that there aren’t any contraindications for the style of massage you want to do.</p><p>When working on yourself, it can be hard to reach your back. Start with a hot pack to soften and relax the muscles. Then, there are a number of ways to reach those sore and hard-to-reach areas:<ul class=leftmargin><li>lean into the corner of a wall using the edge on the muscle on either side of the spine</li><li>lie on a rolled towel and move around until you reach the right area</li><li>lie on a tennis ball on the floor to massage your own back</li></ul></p><p></p>...<a title="Read More" href="/generalmassagetherapy/back-pain-and-how-to-massage-at-home/">read more...</a><p></p><p></p><h4>Why does Jeremy choose to practice Deep Tissue Massage?</h4><div class=date>16 Jan 2014</div><p>With so many types of massage to provide to clients, why do I choose to provide <a href=/generalmassagetherapy/what-is-deep-tissue-massage/index.html>Deep Tissue Massage</a>?

This is due mainly to the fact that one of the major massage therapy schools, the <a href="http://www.collegeofmassage.com/cambridge/">Canadian College of Massage and Hydrotherapy</a>is located in Kitchener. This high volume of massage therapists means higher competition between massage therapists. It also means higher levels of service for you, the massage therapy client. <a href=/about/index.html>Your massage therapist</a>needs to be good to stand out and attract clients.</p><p>With so many registered Massage Therapists in Kitchener-Waterloo, there is no reason you shouldn’t be 100% happy with yours. Don’t be discouraged and don’t feel obligated to rebook or go back if you’re not happy with your new massage therapist. When you are happy, your therapist will appreciate the loyalty.</p><p>There are many therapists trying to set themselves apart from the others by learning and using new styles of <a href=/clinic-information/index.html>massage therapy</a>. There are a lot of styles available for a massage therapist to learn, some of these more effective than others. Don’t be surprised to find your new massage therapist practicing a technique you weren’t expecting. This is fine; for every massage therapy client there is a massage therapist and a different style of massage.</p><p>Since there are over 300 massage therapist in Kitchener and Waterloo, <a href=/contact>don’t be afraid to try a new one</a>.

Whether it is due to a sports injury, bad posture, or a repetitive strain injury at work, most of us, at one point in time, have had low back pain. No matter what the cause, low back pain is a disruption to our lives. It can be a constant dull ache that never goes away, or a sharp piercing pain that stops us from normal function in our lives.</p><p>A worst case scenario would be a disc herniation. This will cause sharp pain in the low back, shooting pain down the back of the legs, and muscle weakness. A disc herniation is most often caused by lifting heavy objects improperly. The most frustrating thing about a disc herniation is that it will not heal on its own. Though a disc herniation is permanent, the pain can be managed quite well with a combination of regular exercise, <a href=/clinic-information/index.html>massage therapy treatments</a>, chiropractic treatments, acupuncture treatments, and other alternative health care treatments.</p><p>Often, that sharp localized pain in the low back is a facet joint compression. The facet joints are the small joints on either side of the spine between every spinal junction. An excessive backward bend or twist can compress or irritate these sensitive joints causing sharp pain. When one of these joints gets compressed, it can be very difficult to release these joints as the muscles around the joint will go into spasm holding the joint tight in its compressed position. It is very helpful to have a series of <a href=/clinic-information/index.html>massage therapy</a>and chiropractic treatments to help correct this condition.</p><p>Deep dull pain is often associated with muscle dysfunction. There are many common ways that muscles will create pain. <a title="Trigger Points and Trigger Point Therapy" href=/generalmassagetherapy/trigger-points-and-trigger-point-therapy/index.html>Trigger Points (TRP)</a>, scar tissue, spasms, and hypertonicity are the most common muscle dysfunctions that I see in my massage therapy <a title=clinic href=/clinic-information/index.html>clinic</a>.</p><p>All of these muscle dysfunctions are created by chronic repetitive actions, and these actions are especially harmful when the body is out of alignment or in an imbalanced position. People perform repetitive actions every single day, and sometimes without even realizing it:</p><ul class=leftmargin><li>moms carrying children on one hip</li><li>manufacturing workers repetitively bending or twisting</li><li>painters repeating the same brush or roller strokes</li><li>construction labourers digging, hammering, or lifting</li><li>office workers seated at a desk all day</li></ul><p>Though we try to do our best to stay in shape, the rigors of daily life can get to be too much for our bodies and minds. <a href=/about/testimonials/index.html>Regular massage therapy treatments</a> can help deal with muscle tension build up. <a href=/stretching/general-guidelines-for-stretching/index.html>Regular stretching</a> and exercising are very good ways to help keep our muscles healthy and free of pain. Walking, rock climbing, and yoga are my favourite ways to keep my muscles and joints healthy.</p>...<a title="Read More" href="/generalmassagetherapy/low-back-pain/">read more...</a><p></p><p></p><h4>March Schedule</h4><div class=date>13 Jan 2014</div><p>I don't very often work on Saturdays but in March I will be working two.

You might be surprised to learn that there are things we can do to improve or prevent the crippling pain of a headache without the use of Tylenol, Advil, or other pain controlling medications. Regular <a href=/stretching/general-guidelines-for-stretching/index.html>stretching</a>, exercise, and <a href=/index.html>massage therapy</a>can bring so much relief you would wonder why you never tried these simple ideas before.</p><p>The most common cause for your headache is Referral Pain from muscle tension in your neck and shoulders. Overuse of vulnerable muscles can cause large painful knots in your muscles called<a title="Trigger Points and Trigger Point Therapy" href=/generalmassagetherapy/trigger-points-and-trigger-point-therapy/index.html>Trigger Points</a>. The pain created by Trigger Points is not always located in the area of the Trigger Point itself. Referred pain from the muscles in your neck and shoulders is often called a tension headache.</p><p>To reduce your tension headache, you need to relax the <a href=/stretching/stretch-your-upper-trapezius-muscle/index.html>affected muscles</a>and reduce these Trigger Points. Three ways for you to do this are to:</p><ul class=leftmargin><li>Relax the muscle through the application of heat</li><li>Stretch the effected muscle</li><li>Massage therapy</li></ul><p>I have detailed a few general neck stretches and exercises below. These stretches target muscles that commonly cause a tension headache. Gentle massage from a loved one can be very beneficial but could potentially cause irritation to the Trigger Point. <a href=/about/index.html>A registered massage therapist</a>is highly skilled in Trigger Point release.</p><p>Be sure to review to my <a href=/stretching/general-guidelines-for-stretching/index.html>General Guidelines for stretching</a>before doing any of the stretches I demonstrate and recommend. It’s always a good idea to see a <a href=/generalmassagetherapy/governance-of-massage-therapy/index.html>health care professional</a>before starting a new exercise program.</p><h2>Muscle #1: Upper Trapezius</h2><p>The <a href=/stretching/stretch-your-upper-trapezius-muscle-2/index.html>Upper Trapezius</a>is a flat triangular muscle that runs from the base of your skull and neck to your shoulder. The Upper Trapezius elevates the shoulder and supports the shoulder girdle when lifting a load. An Upper Trapezius muscle Trigger Point will commonly create pain around the ear and into the temple. Find directions on how to stretch the upper trapezius muscle <a href=/stretching/stretch-your-upper-trapezius-muscle-2/index.html>here</a>.</p><h2>Muscle #2: Levator Scapula</h2><p>The <a href=/stretching/stretch-your-levator-scapula-2/index.html>Levator Scapula</a> muscle runs from the top tip of the shoulder blade up to the top four joints of the neck. The Levator Scapula lifts the shoulder blade and helps control side-to-side movement of the head. A Trigger Point in the Levator Scapula muscle can cause pain behind the head and to the back of the neck.

These muscles control fine movements of your head. Trigger Points in this group of muscles will refer pain into your forehead and behind your eyes.</p><p>Due to the complexity of movements required to stretch the sub-occipital muscles I’m going to suggest gentle self-massage at the space between your neck and the base of your skull.</p>...<a title="Read More" href="/generalmassagetherapy/tension-headaches-3/">read more...</a><p></p><p></p><h4>Governance of massage therapy in Ontario</h4><div class=date>13 Jan 2014</div><p>Massage therapy is a <a href=/knowledge-centre/facts-about-registered-massage-therapy-in-ontario/index.html>regulated health profession</a>.

Trigger Points are found in a tight or stiff band of muscle, and they can be found in muscles throughout the body. The following video shows me describing a Trigger Point to a client:</p><div class=entry-image><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shGC3k2tlb0" data-lightbox=iframe><img src=https://img.youtube.com/vi/shGC3k2tlb0/0.jpg frameborder=0></a></div><p>Trigger Points are sensitive to touch and they usually have a pattern of pain that presents in another part of the body. Sometimes where you hurt is not necessarily where the problem needs to be treated. The Trigger Point Chart below shows you how this referral pain travels. A Trigger Point in the Lower Trapezius muscle (represented as an X in the pink area) can show up as pain at the base of the skull because a Trigger Point in that one muscle can affect a significant area. It is very common to have pain referred from one part of your body to another, and I use Trigger Point Charts in my office to locate, connect, and treat pain on a regular basis.</p><p>&lt;img style=”border: 1px solid black”class=”fleft rightmargin-sm leftmargin-sm” alt=”massage therapis trigger point chart” src=”/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/trigger_point_chart-300x247.jpg” width=”300” height=”247” /&gt;</p><p>Over time, trigger points can create a chronic shortening of affected muscle, and trigger points are often responsible for many chronic pain syndromes such as torticollis, <a href=/generalmassagetherapy/tension-headaches-3/index.html>headaches</a>, <a href=/generalmassagetherapy/low-back-pain/index.html>back pain</a>, knee pain, and postural stress.</p><p>At<a href=/index.html>Kitchener Massage Therapy</a>I use a few different <a href=/generalmassagetherapy/what-is-deep-tissue-massage/index.html>Deep Tissue Massage</a>techniques like muscle stripping, direct pressure held for up to a minute, and <a href=/stretching/general-guidelines-for-stretching/index.html>stretching</a> to treat Trigger Points.</p><p><a href=/generalmassagetherapy/does-deep-tissue-massage-heart/index.html>It is uncomfortable to have a Trigger Point worked out</a>but the relief you get from the <a href=/generalmassagetherapy/tension-headaches-3/index.html>headache</a>, <a href=/generalmassagetherapy/low-back-pain/index.html>sore back</a> or <a href=/generalmassagetherapy/what-can-deep-tissue-massage-treat/index.html>whatever it is you are experiencing</a> can be great. My clients often describe the pain from Trigger Point work as a good pain . I think this stems from the fact that someone has finally been able to pinpoint and address the source of their discomfort after what could have been many years.</p>...<a title="Read More" href="/generalmassagetherapy/trigger-points-and-trigger-point-therapy/">read more...</a><p></p><p></p><h4>Does Deep Tissue Massage Hurt?</h4><div class=date>12 Jan 2014</div><p>Often <a title="Deep tissue massage therapy" href=/generalmassagetherapy/what-is-deep-tissue-massage/index.html>Deep Tissue massage therapy</a> will cause some tenderness when <a title="Jeremy, massage therapist in Kitchener" href=/about/index.html>your massage therapist</a> is working hard to work out the tension, scar tissue, and trigger points from your muscles and ligaments.

The two forms of massage differ in that <a title="Discomfort of deep tissue massage" href=/generalmassagetherapy/does-deep-tissue-massage-heart/index.html>Deep Tissue massage aims to affect the deeper structures of the body</a>and have a deeper level of healing. Deep Tissue massage is very effective in treating chronic muscle and connective tissue injuries.</p><p>In order to access deeper layers of muscle and connective tissue in the body, your massage therapist needs to use considerable pressure; to achieve that pressure, he or she needs skilled in using forearms, elbows, and knuckles to perform the massage techniques.</p><p><a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps/place?rlz=1I7DDCA_en&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;redir_esc=&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=massage+therapist+kitchener&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=ca&amp;hq=massage+therapist&amp;hnear=Kitchener,+ON&amp;cid=4280028541904649170&amp;ei=oGLATc6vDdOftwfb3ey8BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local_result&amp;ct=map-marker-link&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CG4QrwswBg">Deep Tissue massage</a>provides a more therapeutic effect by working more than just superficial layers in the body.
