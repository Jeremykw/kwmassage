<p>If you are getting pain in your upper back, please see your <a href="http://localhost:4000/about/index.html">local massage therapist</a> or other healthcare professional.</p>

<p>Be sure to review to my <a href="http://localhost:4000/stretching/general-guidelines-for-stretching/index.html">General Guidelines for stretching</a> before doing any of the stretches I demonstrate and recommend. Itâ€™s always a good idea to see a <a href="http://localhost:4000/generalmassagetherapy/governance-of-massage-therapy/index.html">health care professional</a> before starting a new exercise program.</p>
