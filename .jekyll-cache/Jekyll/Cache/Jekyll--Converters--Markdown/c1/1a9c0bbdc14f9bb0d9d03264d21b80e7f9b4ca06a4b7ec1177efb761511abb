I"K<p>I'm trying something new this month, I've brought in a product for resale. The <a href="https://acuball.com/product/dr-cohens-acuball/?affiliates=19" target="_blank" title="Acuball">Acuball</a> is something that has been floating around my house for a few years. It's something that I lean on regularly for my own aches and pains. And I often find myself recommending my clients go buy one somewhere else or use a lacrosse ball to achieve a similar effect. I feel that it will be helpful to keep a few in the clinic so that clients can take home exactly what Iâ€™m showing them. </p>
