I"à<p>Itâ€™s May 16th and the weather in the Kitchener, Waterloo has been miserable. We had a few weeks of warmish weather but now we are right back to cold and rainy. You might ask why a <a href="https://www.kwmassage.com/">massage therapist </a>would care about the weather. Itâ€™s been good for business, thatâ€™s why I care. Our muscles get tight and stiff, old pains come back to the surface, and new ones come out. When this happens, we need to see our massage therapist.
